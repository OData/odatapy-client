The code has been briefly verified on Ubuntu using both python2.7 and python3.6. 
The odatacpp-client dependency mentioned in README.md has been replaced with the one from this branch: https://github.com/septimit/odatacpp-client/tree/compile_linux
Use the README file from https://github.com/septimit/odatacpp-client/tree/compile_linux to odatacpp-client compiled on linux.

To compile the code call 'make' command in the current directory.
To use the code with python2.7 one needs to revert the current comments in the Makefile.

As an alternatively, the swig odata_client_python.i definition file is provided and the compilation using swig wrappers generation can be triggered by running make all_swig.
